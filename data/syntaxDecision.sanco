this was just some brainstorming on how the syntax for the file would be, pretty fine with one liners, they look sick

{
    new Funky();
    funky.messages("que", "qué")
    funky.answers("so")
}

Funky() {answers: ("so"), messages: ("que", "qué")}; - the one

[ Funky() { answers: ["so"], messages: ["que", "qué"] }];
